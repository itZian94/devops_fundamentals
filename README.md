# Support Ticket Application
Author: Ian Cunningham

#The name of the game

The idea was to create an application that allows a company to create and collate tickets pertaining to tech support within their organisation. There are two parts: a ticket generation system for company employees, a ticket status system for company technicians, and a portal to access both.

#Project Scope
-A Trello board (or equivalent Kanban board tech) with full expansion
on user stories, use cases and tasks needed to complete the project.
It could also provide a record of any issues or risks that you faced
creating your project.

-A relational database used to store data persistently for the
project, this database needs to have at least 2 tables in it, to
demonstrate your understanding, you are also required to model a
relationship.

-Clear Documentation from a design phase describing the architecture
you will use for you project as well as a detailed Risk Assessment.

-A functional CRUD application created in Python, following best
practices and design principles, that meets the requirements set on
your Kanban Board

-Fully designed test suites for the application you are creating, as
well as automated tests for validation of the application. You must
provide high test coverage in your backend and provide consistent
reports and evidence to support a TDD approach.

-A functioning front-end website and integrated API's, using Flask.

-Code fully integrated into a Version Control System using the
Feature-Branch model which will subsequently be built through a CI
server and deployed to a cloud-based virtual machine.

#Further Opportunities
 I would like to expand this project into a more complete application, adding CSS and Javascript flourishes to improve the front-end experience, and perhaps rewrite the framework using Rust instead of Flask.
